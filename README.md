This project was built as part of CSCI-561 Foundations of Artifical Intelligence at USC.Homework 3 was based on inference in First-Order Logic. I developed an agent using the resolution algorithm that, given a Knowledge Base and a query, determines whether the Knowledge base entails the query.

Involved lexical parsing of logical statement and converting each statement into CNF form. This was done with just the native libraries.
Apply unification algorithm to among clauses of the Knowledge base to resolve the clauses to determine entailment
